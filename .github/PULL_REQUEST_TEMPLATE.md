## Test-Documentation

### Preview links & Sidebar Screenshots

<!-- Use the preview to find examples, select the feature in question and **copy this link here**.
     Find examples of nodes/areas. Find examples with a lot of tags or very few tags. – Whatever helps to test this thoroughly.
     Add relevant **screenshots** of the sidebar of those examples. -->

<!-- FYI: What we will check:
     - Is the [icon](https://github.com/ideditor/schema-builder/blob/main/ICONS.md) well chosen.
     - Are the fields well-structured and have good labels.
     - Do the dropdowns (etc.) work well and show helpful data. -->

### Search

     - Test the preset name as search terms.
