## Processes

### PR Reviews and Merges

- PRs need approval from two people: the author and one or more (co-)maintainers before being merged.
- Non-"clear-cut" changes need to be merged by the maintainer.
- We might revert merges later if necessary.

**What is a clear-cut change?**

- No or minimal controversial discussion on the change.
- Coding and contribution [guidelines](./GUIDELINES.md) are met.

**How to merge…**

- Usually squash merge PRs to make the history simpler
- Give the merge a meaningful description of the change
- Add labels to the PR to simplify creating the changelog: `new-*`, `add-*`, `bug`

### Releases

There is no set release schedule at the moment, but releases usually occur every other month. After this project is released, the projects that rely on the data need to update and release as well.

### Assigning roles

- The maintainer of the iD editor has traditionally and continues to maintain this project.
