## Processes

### PR Reviews and Merges

- PRs need approval from two people: the author and another contributor before being merged.
- Non-"simple" changes need to be merged by the maintainer.
- We might revert merges later if necessary.

### Releases

There is no set release schedule at the moment, but releases usually occur every other month. After this project is released, the projects that rely on the data need to update and release as well.
